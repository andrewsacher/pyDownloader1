NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Figures reflect the number of deaths and Injuries to people on commercial Vessels not resulting from a casualty to the Vessel. These Injuries and Fatalities result from such incidents as slips, falls, or electrocutions. Deaths and Injuries from disease, homicides, suicides, fights, and diving accidents have been excluded. The data reflect deaths and Injuries to people on both U.S. and foreign flag Vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States (within 12 miles of U.S. coast) and on U.S. flag vessels anywhere in the world. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1992-97 data came from the Marine Safety Management Information System. Between 1998 and 2001 the U.S. Coast Guard phased in a new computer system to track safety data, the Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement System. During that period data came from combining entries in the Marine Safety Management Information System with entries in the Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement System. Data for 2002 to 2014 comes from the Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement System. Data prior to 1992 came from other sources and may not be directly comparable to the data from later years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
