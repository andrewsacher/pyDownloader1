The following types of receipts are excluded: 1) revenues collected from users of the transportation system that are directed to the general fund and used for nontransportation purposes, 2) nontransportation general fund revenues that are used to finance transportation programs and 3) proceeds from borrowing.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The big jump of federal user coverage (percent) in 1999 is due to the fact that Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allowed taxpayers to delay depositing highway motor fuel tax receipts that would have been required to be made in August and September of 1998 until October 5, 1998. October 5, 1998 is in fiscal year 1999. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User coverage ratio is a measure of the extent to which federal outlays on transportation programs are covered by receipt from transportation- related taxes and charges that are earmarked for transportation programs. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
