"a All public road and street mileage in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. For years prior to 1980, some miles of nonpublic roadways are included. No consistent data on private road mileage are available. Beginning in 1998, approximately 43,000 miles of Bureau of Land Management Roads are excluded. 2010 Missouri and Wyoming's data are 2009.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Data represent miles of road owned (aggregate length of road, excluding yard tracks, sidings, and parallel lines).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Portions of Class I freight railroads, Amtrak, and Commuter rail networks share common trackage. Amtrak data represent miles of road operated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Transit system length is measured in directional route-miles. Directional route-miles are the distance in each direction over which public transportation vehicles travel while in revenue service. Directional route-miles are computed with regard to direction of service, but without regard to the number of traffic lanes or rail tracks existing in the right-of-way. Beginning in 2002, directional route-mileage data for the Commuter and Light rail modes include purchased transportation. 2005 and later years directional route-mileage data for the Heavy rail mode include purchased transportation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e Beginning in 2011, Light rail includes Light Rail, Street Car Rail, and Hybrid Rail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f These are estimated sums of all domestic waterways which include rivers, bays, channels, and the inner route of the Southeast Alaskan Islands, but does not include the Great Lakes or deep ocean traffic. The Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center monitored 12,612 miles as commercially significant inland shallow-draft waterways in 2001. Beginning in 2007, waterways connecting lakes and the St. Lawrence seaway inside the U.S. are included. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
g The large drop in mileage between 2000 and 2001 is due to a change in the source of the data. CO2 or other is excluded for 2004 to 2008. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
h Includes trunk and gathering lines for crude-oil pipeline.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i Data not adjusted to common diameter equivalent. Mileage as of the end of each year. Data includes gathering, transmission, and distribution mains. Prior to 1985 data also include field lines. See table 1-10 for a more detailed breakout of Oil and Gas pipeline mileage. Length data reported in Gas Facts prior to 1985 was taken from the American Gas Association's member survey, the Uniform Statistical Report, supplemented with estimates for companies that did not participate. Gas Facts length data is now based on information reported to the U.S. Department of Transportation on Form 7100. Since data for 1985 and later years are obtained from the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, data for these years are not comparable with prior years or with numbers published in the previous NTS reports.
