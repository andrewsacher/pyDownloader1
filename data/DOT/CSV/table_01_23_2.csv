NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prior to 2000, the country of manufacture was recognized as the producing country. To conform with current OICA (International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers) practices, starting in 2000, the country of final assembly was recognized as the producing country. This explains the sudden change in trends across some countries from 1999 to 2000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding. Also numbers may not add to totals due to the inclusion of small countries in the total.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
