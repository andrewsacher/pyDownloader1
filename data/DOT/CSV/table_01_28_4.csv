NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For the data for 2000 -15, Deficiency (Structurally Deficient, SD, and Functionally Obsolete, FO) are defined in http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/0650dsup.cfm (Note: Bridges with a Year Built or Year Reconstructed within the past 10 years will not be assigned a deficient status.) Therefore, when referring to the deficiency being calculated not using the 10-yr rule, the status will be calculated without taking into consideration the year built or the year reconstructed. A text definition of SD and FO can be found in the Bridge Conditions section of Chapter 3 of the latest ""Status of the Nation's Highways, Bridges, and Transit: Conditions & Performance, Report to Congress"" http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/2010cpr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Explanations for the terms Structurally Deficient and Functionally Obsolete for years before 2000 can be found on pages 14 and 15 in Chapter 3 of the Federal Highway Administration, 2006 Conditions and Performance Report, available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/2006cpr/pdfs/chap3.pdf.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"U.S. totals include the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Table includes: Rural–Interstate, principal arterial, minor arterial, major collector, minor collector and local roads; Urban–Interstate, other freeways or expressways, other principal arterial, minor arterial, collector, and local roads. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data for 1990, 1992, 1997-99, 2000, and 2001-15 are as of December of those years; data for 1991 and 1994-96 are as of June of those years; data for 1993 are as of September of that year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The deficiency status of the data for 2001-15  has been calculated by not taking into consideration the year built or the year reconstructed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
