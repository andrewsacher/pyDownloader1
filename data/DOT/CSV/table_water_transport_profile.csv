"b Does not include vessel operators whose primary area of operation is fishing, towing, passenger transport, ferrying, or crew boat utility service.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Data for 2002 is based on new NAICS classifications and therefore comparisons between 2002 data and data for prior years may be misleading. Prior to 2002 water transportation was calculated based on SIC classifications and included commercial port, marina, and other employees; excluding employees of not-for-hire private businesses. Data for water transportation in 2002 includes NAICS categories 483100, 483200, 488300. Data for ships, boat building, and repairing is based on the NAICS category 336600.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Estimate based on established active jobs for licensed and unlicensed personnel aboard oceangoing ships of 1,000 gross-tons and over, privately owned and operated, government-owned ships under bare boat charters, ship managers and General Agency Agreement, supplemented by Military Sealift Command employment totals for ships with Civil Service crews.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e Data is current as of January 1 of the following year with the exception of 1999 data, which is current as of Apr. 1, 1999.  Due to a change in the source's periodicity, the data for 1999 is not comparable to the data from years prior to 1999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f Freighters data include bulk carriers prior to calendar year 1983.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g The U.S. Coast Guard changed its methodology for counting the number of recreational boats.  Figures cited represent number of numbered boats, not estimates as previously noted for 1960 and 1970.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h Does not include intraterritorial traffic (traffic between ports in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which are considered a single unit).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i 1992-2002 data come from the Marine Safety Management Information System.  Data for prior years may not be directly comparable.  Beginning in 2000, numbers may not add to totals because data is now recorded in a new information system known as MISLE, which does not associate every fatality and injury with a specific vessel.
