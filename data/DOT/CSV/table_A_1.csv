"b New metropolitan area definitions were published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 2003. These definitions were applied to population data by the Census Bureau beginning with the data from the 2000 Census. A new term, core based statistical areas (CBSAs), collectively refers to metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. A metropolitan statistical area is defined as having at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants. A micropolitan statistical area is defined as having at least one urban cluster of more than 10,000 but less than 50,000 inhabitants. All geographic boundaries for the July 1, 2009 population estimates series are defined as of January 1, 2009.  The Office of Management and Budget's statistical area definitions for metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, as well as metropolitan divisions, are those issued by that agency in November 2008. The estimates for 2010-12 are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions.  The Office of Management and Budget's statistical area delineations for metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, as well as metropolitan divisions, are those issued by that agency in February 2013.
