"KEY: CO = carbon monoxide; g = gram; g/kN = grams of pollutant per kilonewtons of thrust; HC = hydrocarbon, kN = kilonewtons; kW = kilowatt; NOx = nitrogen oxides; rO = rated output, which is the maximum power or thrust available for takeoff; rPR = rated pressure ratio. ",,,,,,,,,

"a Federal standards apply to all planes operating in the United States, regardless of where they were manufactured.  This table primarily displays exhaust emissions standards for newly manufactured aircraft engines.  Only two standards (smoke standards) have been set for in-use aircraft engines (see footnotes i and k). Therefore, unless otherwised noted, emissions in this table apply to new aircraft engines only. ",,,,,,,,,
"b HC, CO, and NOx are measured using the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Gaseous Emissions Test Procedure. Smoke is measured using the ICAO Smoke Emission Test Procedure.  There is no useful life or warranty period for purposes of compliance with emissions standards. ",,,,,,,,,
c Examples of commercial aircraft that use each engine type include the following:,,,,,,,,,
"Class T3 turbojet–Boeing 707-320s (Class T3 engines are currently out of production, though some are still in use).",,,,,,,,,
"Class T8 turbojet–Boeing 727s and 737-200s, and McDonnell-Douglas MD-80s and DC-9s.",,,,,,,,,
"Turbofans and turbojets other than T3, T8, and TSS–Boeing 747-400s, 757s, 767-200s and 777s, and McDonnell-Douglas MD-11s; Canadair Regional Jets.",,,,,,,,,
"Turboprops–Used mostly in regional airliners such as ATR 72, Dornier 328,  and Saab SF 340.",,,,,,,,,
TSS–British Aircraft Corp./Aerospatiale Concorde (the only supersonic aircraft currently used in commercial civil aviation).,,,,,,,,,
d Applies to engines with rO>26.7 kN.,,,,,,,,,
"e Effective as of July 7, 1997.  This standard applies only to those engines of a type or model for which the date of manufacture of the first individual production model was on or before Dec. 31, 1995 and for which the date of manufacture of the individual engine was on or before Dec. 31, 1999.",,,,,,,,,
"f Effective as of July 7, 1997.  This standard also applies to engines of a type or model for which the date of manufacture of the first individual production model was after Dec. 31, 1995 and for which the date of manufacture of the individual engine was after Dec. 31, 1999.",,,,,,,,,
"g Engines with rO>=1,000 kW.",,,,,,,,,
"h Engines manufactured on or after Jan. 1, 1984 and with rO>=26.7 kN.  Smoke number may not exceed 50.",,,,,,,,,
i Engines with rated output rO>=129 kN. This is also the in-use standard for all such aircraft engines.,,,,,,,,,
j Engines with rO<26.7 kN. Smoke number may not exceed 50.,,,,,,,,,
"k Class T8 turbojet engines shall not exceed a smoke number of 30 beginning Feb. 1, 1974.",,,,,,,,,
