NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alcohol involvement pertains to any driver, pedestrian, or pedalcyclist involved in the accident. Alcohol results are determined from positive blood alcohol concentration tests and police-reported alcohol involvement and are adjusted by the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2001, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) adopted a new method, i.e., multiple imputation, to estimate missing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) test result data. This new method is being used by NHTSA's National Center for Statistics and Analysis (NCSA) to improve the scope of alcohol involvement statistics by the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS). As a result, alcohol involvement fatalities have undergone a complete revision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The sum of individual categories may not add to totals because NCSA generates a separate estimate for each category of fatalities, including total fatalities. The estimates are rounded to the nearest whole number.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The total motorist and nonmotorist fatalities data in this table are not comparable to total motorist and nonmotorist fatality data in other NTS tables that cite the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Traffic Safety Facts publication as a source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
