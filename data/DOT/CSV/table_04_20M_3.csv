"a 1960-2006 data are for Passenger Cars and Other 2-axle, 4-tire vehicles, respectively. Data for 1960-2006 are not comparable to data for 2007-12.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), provides data separately for Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) and Motorcycle in its annual Highway Statistics series. However, the 1995 summary report provides updated data for Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) and Motorcycle combined. Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) figures in this table were computed by U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, by subtracting the most current motorcycle figures from the aggregate Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) and Motorcycle figures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c 1960-65, Motorcycle data are included in Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car), and Long duty vehicle, long wheel base (formerly Other 2-axle 4-tire vehicle) data are included in Single-unit 2-axle 6-tire or more Truck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d In July 1997, the FHWA published revised vehicle-miles data for the highway modes for many years. The major change reflected the reassignment of some vehicles from the Passenger cars category to the Other 2-axle 4-tire vehicles category.  This category was calculated prior to rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To calculate total Btu, multiply fuel consumed (see tables 4-21, 4-22, 4-24, 4-26) by 135,000 Btu/gallon for air carrier; 125,000 Btu/gallon for Light duty vehicle, short wheel base, Light duty vehicle, long wheel base, and Motorcycle; 138,700 Btu/gallon for Transit motor bus and Amtrak diesel consumption; and 3,412 Btu/KwH for Amtrak electric consumption.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amtrak passenger-miles data for 2000 and earlier years are for fiscal years; and are not be comparable with 2001 and later years which is reported in calendar year. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transit motor bus data for 1996 and later years are obtained from the National Transit Database and cannot be compared with data for earlier years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers, 1 gallon = 3.785412 litres, 1 Btu = 1.055056 kilojoule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
