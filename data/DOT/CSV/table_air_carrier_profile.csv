a  Some totals include data not in the table; thus totals may not equal sum of table data. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b  Includes scheduled and nonscheduled (charter) operators. By Sec. 2 of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 ""charter air carrier"" and ""charter air transportation"" replaced supplemental air carriers and supplemental air transportation, which were formerly Sec. 101(36) and (37) of the Act.  The 24 pre-deregulation supplemental carriers now have scheduled service authority. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c  Total includes only those carriers who have reported employment statistics to BTS' Office of Airline Information. Full-time equivalent employees count two part-time employees as one full-time equivalent employee. Prior to 1980, there was no breakout for part-time employees so earlier numbers will overstate full-time equivalent employees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d  Data does not include small-certificated and commuter carriers prior to 2002. Small-certificated and commuter carriers began reporting T1 data in January of 2002 for Alaskan carriers and in October of 2002 for the remainder of the U.S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
