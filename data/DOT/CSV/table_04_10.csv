"Beginning with 2003 data, the methodology used to develop the estimates of alternative fueled vehicles (AFVs) in use and alternate transportation fuel consumption were changed. The data reflect this new methodology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The traditional fuel consumption data in this table are slightly different from the fuel consumption data in table 4-9 due to different sources.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
