KEY:  Btu = British thermal unit; kWh = kilowatt hour.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a Revenue passenger-miles data prior to 2001 are fiscal year data; 2001 data and more recent data are calendar year data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Does not include electric power generation and distribution losses, which, if included, would triple the electric conversion factor given below and increase the numbers in this row by about 20 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c Electric usage and diesel usage data are calendar year data.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The heat equivalent factors used in Btu conversion are: diesel = 138,700 Btu/gallon; electric = 3,412 Btu/kWh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
