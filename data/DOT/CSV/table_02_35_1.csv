NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Light rail and Heavy rail Grade crossings are regulated by the Federal Transit Administration. The Federal Transit Administration defines two types of Grade crossings: (1) At grade, mixed, and cross traffic crossings, meaning railway right-of-way over which other traffic moving in the same direction or other cross directions may pass. This includes city street right-of-way; (2) At grade with cross traffic crossings, meaning railway right-of-way over which no other traffic may pass, except to cross at grade-level crossings. This can include median strip rights-of-way with grade level crossings at intersecting streets. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Commuter rail Grade crossings are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration. The Federal Railroad Administration defines a Grade crossing as a location where a public highway, road, street, or private roadway, including associated sidewalks and pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All transit rail, total includes data for other transit rail modes which are not presented in this table (such as monorail), thus details may not add to totals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Automated guideway category is added in 2014 Q4 edition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
