NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The injury and crash data in this table are from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) General Estimates System (GES). The data from GES, which began operation in 1988, are obtained from a nationally representative probability sample selected from all police-reported crashes. The GES sample includes only crashes where a police accident report was completed and the crash resulted in property damage, injury, or death. The resulting figures do not take into account crashes that were not reported to the police or that did not result in property damage. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rates per 100 million vehicle-miles figures may differ from those in the source data due to rounding by the source.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
