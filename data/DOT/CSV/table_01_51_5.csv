NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All data: Trade levels reflect the mode of transportation as a shipment enters or exits at a border port. Flows through individual ports are based on reported data collected from U.S. trade documents. Trade does not include low-value shipments.  (In general, these are imports valued at less than $1,250 and exports that are valued at less than $2,500).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Air: Data for all air gateways are reported at the port level and include a low level (generally less than 2%-3% of the total value) of small user-fee airports located in the same region.  Air gateways not identified by airport name (e.g., Chicago, IL and others) include major airport(s) in that geographic area in addition to small regional airports. In addition, due to Bureau of Census confidentiality regulations, data for courier operations are included in the airport totals for JFK International Airport, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, Anchorage, and Cleveland.
