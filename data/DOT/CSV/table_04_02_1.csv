a  Discontinuity in data between earlier years and 1990 is due to attempts to include sector consumption of renewable energy beginning in that year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The data for Residential, Commercial, and Industrial sectors include only fossil fuels consumed directly. Most renewable fuels are not included. The data for the Transportation sector includes only fossil and renewable fuels consumed directly. The data for Electric utilities includes all fuels (fossil, nuclear, geothermal, hydro, and other renewables) used by electric utilities. Due to a lack of consistent historical data, some renewable energy resources are not included in this table. The totals in table 4-4 are the best numbers for total U.S. energy consumption from all sources.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
