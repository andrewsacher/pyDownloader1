"a Air carriers operating under 14 CFR 135, scheduled service. Includes accidents involving all-cargo air carriers when those accidents occurred during scheduled 14 CFR 135 operations. Before Mar. 20, 1997, 14 CFR 135 applied to aircraft with 30 or fewer seats.  Since Mar. 20, 1997, 14 CFR 135 includes only aircraft with fewer than 10 seats. This change makes it difficult to compare pre-1997 data with more recent years' data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

c An attempted suicide case in 1992 is included in accidents but excluded in accident rates in this table.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Miles, departures, and hours are compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration. Rates are computed by dividing the number of Fatalities, Serious injured persons, Total accidents, and Total accidents, fatal by the number of Aircraft-miles, Aircraft departures, or Flight hours. These figures are based on information provided by airlines to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Office of Airline Information. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The illegal acts, such as suicide, sabotage and terrorism, are included in the totals for accidents,  fatalities, and rate computation. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
