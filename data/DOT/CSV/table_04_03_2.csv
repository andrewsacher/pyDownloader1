NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation's share of U.S. petroleum demand in this table differs slightly from table 4-1 because this table takes into account differences within sectors in the use of various grades of petroleum-based fuel that have a different Btu content per unit volume. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sum of components may not add to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
