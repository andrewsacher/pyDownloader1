"a Data from 1990 through 1997 include local trucking (4212), trucking, except local (4213), local trucking, without storage (4214), and courier services, except air (4215) based on SIC (Standard Industrial Classification). For 1998 and later, data includes truck transportation (484) and couriers and messengers (492) based on NAICS (North American Industry Classification System). Therefore, data from 1998 onward are not directly comparable with data prior to 1998.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Excludes commuter rail, automated guideway, urban boat, demand responsive, and most rural and smaller systems prior to 1984. Includes operating assistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c Amtrak began operations in 1971.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d Includes foreign traffic moving on domestic inland waterways.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e Oil pipeline revenues are much smaller than gas pipeline revenues because oil pipeline companies are common carriers that include transportation costs only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f Data are not directly comparable from year to year due to acquisition and mergers. Prior to 1975, pipeline companies are not categorized by distribution, integrated, or combination. Total numbers for these companies are 1960 = 5,505; 1965 = 7,437; 1970 = 10,542. In 1997, the American Gas Association revised the database that identifies companies by type (distribution, integrated, or transmission). This reclassification of companies has resulted in numerous additions to the distribution company sample, in particular from the integrated company sample.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eno Transportation Foundation has revised their methodologies for calculating water transportation and oil pipeline data series starting in 1990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
