"a Smoke opacity is expressed in percentage for acceleration, lugging, and peak modes (acceleration/lugging/peak).  Lugging is when a vehicle is carrying a load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is the maximum design loaded weight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Several testing procedures have been used during the course of exhaust emissions control.  A steady-state 9-mode test procedure (13-mode for diesel) was used for 1970-83 standards.  For 1984, either the steady-state tests or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transient test procedure could be used.  For diesels, the EPA transient test was required from 1985 to the present.  For gasoline-powered vehicles, either the EPA or the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) transient test procedure could be used during 1985-86, and the MVMA procedure was required thereafter. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Emissions standards apply to the useful life of the vehicle.  Useful life was 5 years/50,000 miles through 1983 and became 8 years/110,000 miles beginning in model year 1985. 1984 was a transitional year in which vehicles could meet the older standard (and test procedure) or the newer one.  Useful life requirement for gasoline-powered trucks meeting NOx standards for 1998 and after is 10 years/110,000 miles.  Starting in 2004, the useful life will be 10 years/110,000 miles.  The useful life requirements for heavy-duty diesel truck standards are more complex and vary by vehicle weight, pollutant, test procedure, and year.  Consult the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for further information. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e No standard set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f Although emissions standards for HC and CO were in effect for these years, they were not measured in grams per brake horsepower-hour and are, therefore, incompatible with the engine certification section of this table. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g Vehicles can meet a NMHC + NOx standard of 2.5 g/bhp-h, given they meet a NMHC standard of no more than 0.5 g/bhp-h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"h Starting in 2005, complete gasoline heavy-duty vehicles of 14,000 lbs GVWR or below will have to be chassis certified.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i The manufacturer has the option of satisfying this standard by measurement of nonmethane hydrocarbons or total hydrocarbons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
j The manufacturer has the option of satisfying this standard by measurement of nonmethane organic gas or total hydrocarbons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"k This test procedure currently exists to test complete vehicles that have been optionally chassis certified.  However, chassis certification is not required until 2005.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
l Required for complete gasoline heavy-duty vehicles only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tables 4-32a and 4-32b are identical for heavy-duty diesel engines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
