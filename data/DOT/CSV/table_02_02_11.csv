NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To reduce double counting, the following adjustments are made to Total Injuries: For Railroad, injuries involving motor vehicles at public highway-rail grade crossings are excluded because such fatalities are assumed to be included in Highway fatalities. For Transit, non-rail modes, including aerial tramway, motor bus, bus rapid transit, commuter bus, demand response, demand taxi, ferryboat, jitney, publico, trolleybus, and vanpool injuries are excluded because they are counted as Water and Highway fatalities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Highway numbers including totals are estimates rather than actual counts. The estimates are calculated from data obtained from a nationally representative sample of crashes collected through NHTSA's General Estimates System (GES). Estimates are rounded to the nearest 1,000. Estimates less than 500 indicate that the sample size was too small to produce a meaningful estimate and should be rounded to zero.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Water injury data for 2001 and before is not comparable with later year due to a change in the reporting system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Current version of this table is not comparable with the versions before 2014 because of the categories changing for some modes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
