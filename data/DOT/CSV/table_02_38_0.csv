NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data are from transit agencies in urbanized areas over 200,000 population and include patrons, employees, and others. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The figures for violent and property crime follow the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook (Washington, DC:  1984) and are based on records of calls for service, complaints, and/or investigations.  These figures are for reported offenses and do not reflect the findings of a court, coroner, jury, or decision of a prosecutor.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Security data was first reported to the Federal Transit Administration in 1995 and was not compiled for earlier years. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beginning in 2002, data are no longer collected for the following offenses: Sex offenses, Drug abuse violations, Driving under the influence, Drunkenness, Disorderly conduct, and Curfew and loitering laws. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Analysts for the FTA believe the change in reporting requirements in 2002 may have resulted in unreliable data in that year. The reliability of reporting is believed to be much better in 2003 and is expected to improve in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An Aggravated Assault, Robbery or Theft  has the potential to be either a reportable incident or a Safety and Security Monthly Summary incident, only the incidents meeting the thresholds are reported on the Reportable Incident form (S&S-40) e.g., injuries requiring immediate medical attention away from the scene for one or more persons. Prior to 2008, these Part I offenses were reported on occurrence, thus there were higher report totals for previous years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Prior to 2010, an unconfirmed injury had the potential of resulting into reports of Aggravated assault. In the 2010 manual clarification was made in the definition, arrests/citations with no reportable injuries now results in Other assaults category. The distinction was clarified in the 2010 Safety and Security reporting manual. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
