"c U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), provides data separately for Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) and Motorcycle in its annual Highway Statistics series. However, the 1995 summary report provides updated data for Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) and Motorcycle combined. Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) figures in this table were computed by U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, by subtracting the most current motorcycle figures from the aggregate Light duty vehicle, short wheel base (formerly Passenger car) and Motorcycle figures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"e In July 1997, the FHWA published revised vehicle-miles data for the highway modes for many years.

A 10-car train traveling 1 mile would equal 1 train-mile and 10 car-miles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"l Although both Train-miles and Car-miles are shown for rail, only Train-miles are included in the total. A Train-mile is the movement of a train, which can consist of multiple vehicles (cars), the distance of 1 mile. This differs from a vehicle-mile, which is the movement of 1 vehicle the distance of 1 mile. A 10-vehicle train traveling 1 mile would be measured as 1 train-mile and 10 vehicle-miles. Caution should be used when comparing train-miles with vehicle miles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Data for 2007-14 were calculated using a new methodology developed by FHWA. Data for these years are based on new categories and are not comparable to previous years. The new category Light duty vehicle, short wheel base includes passenger cars, light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles with a wheelbase (WB) equal to or less than 121 inches. The new category Light duty vehicle, long wheel base includes large passenger cars, vans, pickup trucks, and sport/utility vehicles with wheelbases (WB) larger than 121 inches. This edition of 1-35 is not comparable to previous editions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
