NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data from 1996 and after are not comparable to the data for earlier years or to the data published in previous editions of the report due to different data sources used.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data from 1997 and after are for those vehicles used for both directly operated (DO) and purchased transportation (PT) services.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data from 2011 includes all buses including rapid transit as well as commuter buses. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Energy consumed, total does not include the other types of energy identified in table 17 in the National Transit Database due to the lack of  information on the unit of measurement for such data before 2008.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The following conversion rates were used:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Diesel =138,700 Btu/gallon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Compressed natural gas = 22,500 Btu/gallon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bio-Diesel = 126,200 Btu/gallon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Liquefied natural gas = 84,800 Btu/gallon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gasoline = 125,000 Btu/gallon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Liquefied petroleum gas = 91,300 Btu/gallon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
