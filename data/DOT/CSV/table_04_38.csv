Useful life,(Class I),50-169 cc,,"5 years or 12,000 km (7,456 mi), whichever comes first",,,
,(Class II),170-279 cc,,"5 years or 18,000 km (11,185 mi), whichever comes first",,,
,(Class III),280 cc and greater,,"5 years or 30,000 km (18,641 mi), whichever comes first",,,
KEY: cc = cubic centimeters; D = engine displacement; g = gram; HC = hydrocarbon; h = hour; kg = kilogram; km = kilometer; lb = pound; LPG = liquefied petroleum gas; mi = miles; mph = miles per hour. ,,,,,,,

"a A motorcycle is any motor vehicle with a headlight, taillight, and stoplight, and having two or three wheels and a curb mass less than or equal to 793 kg (1,749 lb). (The limit was 680 kg, or 1,499 lb prior to the 1998 model year.) A motorcycle is excluded from the standards if it has a displacement of less than 50 cc (3.1 cubic inches) or if with a 80 kg (176 lb) driver it cannot start from a dead stop using only the engine or exceed a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) on a level, paved surface. ",,,,,,,
"b Readers who wish to compare motorcycle regulations with passenger car and truck regulations should note that 5.0 g/km = 8.0 g/mi and 12 g/km = 19 g/mi. The formula for 1978-79 HC emissions by motorcycles 170-749 cc becomes, in g/mi., approximately 8.0 + 0.025(D-170). ",,,,,,,
c Estimates of emissions rates prior to controls are ranges of emissions for all engine displacements. Not available for motorcycles powered by fuels other than gasoline. ,,,,,,,
"d D = engine displacement in cubic centimeters (cc).  For example, the standard for a 300 cc engine would be 5.0 + 0.0155(300-170) = 7.0 g/km. ",,,,,,,
