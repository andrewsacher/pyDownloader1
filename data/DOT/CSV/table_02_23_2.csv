NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Large trucks - trucks over 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating, including single-unit trucks and truck tractors. Light trucks - trucks of 10,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less, including pickups, vans, truck-based station wagons, and utility vehicles. The injury and crash data in this table are from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) General Estimates System (GES). The data from GES, which began operation in 1988, are obtained from a nationally representative probability sample selected from all police-reported crashes. The GES sample includes only crashes where a police accident report was completed and the crash resulted in property damage, injury, or death.  The resulting figures do not take into account crashes that were not reported to the police or that did not result in property damage. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vehicle-miles in this table and in table 2-19 are taken from NHTSA revised data and are not based exclusively on USDOT, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) data, as they have been in earlier reports. The change was made to reflect the different vehicle classification schemes used by FHWA and NHTSA. Thus, Vehicle-miles for passenger cars and Light and Large trucks in table 2-19 and this table should not be compared with Vehicle-miles in Chapter 1, which are taken directly from FHWA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rates per 100 million vehicle-miles figures may not match those in the source data due to rounding by the source. The category Trucks involved in crashes, total, is not comparable to the category Crashes, that appeared in this table in 2008 and previous editions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
