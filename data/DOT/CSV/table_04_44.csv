NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As of July 1 of each year. Vehicle types are defined as follows: light-duty vehicles (passenger cars up to 6,000 lb gross vehicle weight rating GVWR) ; light-duty trucks (pickups and minivans up to 8,500 lb GVWR); heavy-duty vehicles (8,501 lb or more GVWR); motorcycle (on-highway only).  The data in this table are based on MOBILE6, and reflect the introduction of RFG starting in 1995. Interested readers can learn more about the MOBILE6 model at the following USEPA Internet site http://www.epa.gov/otaq/m6.htm. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Emissions factors are national averages based on the following assumptions: ambient temperature 75 ºF, daily temperature range 60 -84 ºF, average traffic speed 27.6 mph (representative of overall traffic in urban areas), standard operating mode (cold-start, hot-start, stabilized), vehicle-miles traveled fractions and no inspection/maintenance or antitampering programs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emissions estimates in this table assume 100% RFG.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Average emissions per vehicle rates assume a fleet comprised exclusively of reformulated gasoline and diesel vehicles. For emissions estimates of a fleet using gasoline and diesel, see table 4-38.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
