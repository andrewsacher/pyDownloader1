KEY:  Btu = British thermal unit; kWh = kilowatt hour; U = data are not available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a Energy use for 1994 on is not directly comparable to earlier years. Some commuter rail energy use may have been inadvertently included in earlier years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Includes electric power generation and distribution losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Energy intensity (Btu/revenue passenger-mile) is calculated by the source and may differ from direct calculations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The heat equivalent factors used in Btu conversion are: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Diesel = 138,700 Btu/gallon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Electric = 10,399 Btu/kWh. The electric conversion factor takes into account losses associated with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, and thus it is more than three times the value of the factor that is used in table 4-26.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
