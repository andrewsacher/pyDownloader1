"a Smoke opacity is expressed in percentage for acceleration, lugging, and peak modes (acceleration/lugging/peak).  Lugging is when a vehicle is carrying a load.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b Gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) is the maximum design loaded weight.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Several testing procedures have been used during the course of exhaust emissions control.  A steady-state 9-mode test procedure (13-mode for diesel) was used for 1970-83 standards. For 1984, either the steady-state tests or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transient test procedure could be used.  For diesels, the EPA transient test was required from 1985 to the present.  For gasoline-powered vehicles, either the EPA or the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) transient test procedure could be used during 1985-86, and the MVMA procedure was required thereafter. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Emissions standards apply to the useful life of the vehicle.  Useful life was 5 years/50,000 miles through 1983 and became 8 years/110,000 miles beginning in model year 1985. 1984 was a transitional year in which vehicles could meet the older standard (and test procedure) or the newer one.  Useful life requirement for gasoline-powered trucks meeting NOx standards for 1998 and after is 10 years/110,000 miles.  Starting in 2004, the useful life will be 10 years/110,000 miles.  The useful life requirements for heavy-duty diesel truck standards are more complex and vary by vehicle weight, pollutant, test procedure, and year.  Consult the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations for further information. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e No standard set.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f Although emissions standards for HC and CO were in effect for these years, they were not measured in grams per brake horsepower-hour and are, therefore, incompatible with this table. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"g Vehicles can meet a NMHC +  NOx standard of 2.5 g/bhp-h, given they meet a NMHC standard of no more than 0.5 g/bhp-h.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tables 4-32a and 4-32b are identical for heavy-duty diesel engines.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
