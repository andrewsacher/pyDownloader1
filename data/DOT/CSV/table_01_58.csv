NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding. Value-of-shipment estimates are reported in current prices. Coverage for the 2002 and 2007 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) differs from the previous surveys due to a change from the 1997 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and other survey improvements. The 2007 estimates are derived using an improved methodology of estimation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
