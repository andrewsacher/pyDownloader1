NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Passenger miles is the summation of all modes from table 1-40 less transit motor bus and demand responsive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ton-miles is the summation of all modes from table 1-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chained (2009) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2009 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To make all the data comparable, all index data are using year 1997 as the base year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This table is not comparable with the previous'  version. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
