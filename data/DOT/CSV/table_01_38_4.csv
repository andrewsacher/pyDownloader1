NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Average length of haul for freight is calculated by dividing ton-miles by estimates of tonnage from the various data sources. The calculation of average length of haul for passenger trips varies by mode:  for air carrier it is calculated by dividing revenue passenger-miles by revenue passenger enplanements; for commuter rail and Amtrak it is calculated by dividing passenger-miles by number of passengers. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eno Transportation Foundation has discontinued some data series years prior to 1990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
