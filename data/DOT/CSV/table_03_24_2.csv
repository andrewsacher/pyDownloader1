NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) uses a mail survey to measure employment levels and wage rates for all full- and part-time wage and salary workers in nonfarm establishments. The survey does not include self-employed owners and partners in unincorporated firms, household workers, or unpaid family workers.  In 1999, OES began using the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system to organize occupational data.  Consequently, estimates from 1999 and subsequent years are not directly comparable to previous occupational estimates. The SOC is being adopted by all federal agencies and consists of 821 detailed occupations, grouped into 449 board occupations, 96 minor groups, and 23 major groups.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A broad definition of transportation and transportation-related occupations is used in this table based on Sen, B. and M. Rossetti, ""A Complete Count of the U.S. Transportation Workforce,"" Transportation Research Record 1719: 2000, pp 259-266.  Some occupational categories may include workers not engaged in transportation or transportation-related activities.  For example, the category ""first-line supervisors/managers"" (53-1021 and 53-1031) may include workers in material moving occupations along with transportation occupations. Moreover, some workers engaged in transportation and transportation-related activities may be excluded. For example, ""baggage porters and bellhops"" is not included in this table because it is believed that a large share of workers in this category work in hotels or similar establishments. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2010, the standard occupational classification code for Travel guides, Flight attendants and Transportation attendants, Except flight attendants and baggage are changed to 39-7012, 53-2031 and 53-6061 respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
