"To reduce double counting, the following adjustments are made to Total Fatalities: For Railroad, fatalities involving motor vehicles at public highway-rail grade crossings are excluded because such fatalities are assumed to be included in Highway fatalities. For Transit, non-rail modes, including aerial tramway, motor bus, bus rapid transit, commuter bus, demand response, demand taxi, ferryboat, jitney, publico, trolleybus, and vanpool fatalities are excluded because they are counted as Water and Highway fatalities. Other counts, redundant with above help eliminate double counting in the Total Fatalities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Highway fatalities data prior to 1975 have been adjusted to reflect the Fatality Analysis Reporting System's definition of a fatal crash as one that involves a motor vehicle on a traffic way that results in the death of a vehicle occupant or a nonmotorist within 30 days of the crash.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Water injury data for 2001 and before is not comparable with later year due to a change in the reporting system.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Current version of this table is not comparable with the versions before 2014 because of the categories changing for some modes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
