"a Amtrak changed its method for reporting delays in 2000.  Therefore, the data for 2000 and following years are not comparable with prior years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Includes all delays that occur when operating on Amtrak owned tracks and all delays for equipment or engine failure, passenger handling, holding for connections, train servicing, and mail/baggage handling when on tracks of a host railroad.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Includes all operating delays not attributable to Amtrak when operating on tracks of a host railroad, such as track and signal related delays, power failures, freight and commuter train interference, routing delays, etc.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Includes delays not attributable to Amtrak or other host railroads, such as customs and immigration, law enforcement action, weather, or waiting for scheduled departure time. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTES ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Host railroad is a freight or commuter railroad over which Amtrak trains operate for all or part of their trip.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All percentages are based on Amtrak's fiscal year (October 1–September 30).  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Amtrak trains are considered on time if arrival at the endpoint is within the minutes of scheduled arrival time as shown on the following chart. Trip length is based on the total distance traveled by that train from origin to destination:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trip length (miles),Minutes late at endpoint ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
