NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data for 2007-13 was calculated using a new methodology for light duty vehicles and motorcycles developed by FHWA. Data for these years are based on new categories and are not comparable to previous years. The new category Light duty vehicle, long wheel base includes large passenger cars, vans, pickup trucks, and sport/utility vehicles with wheelbases (WB) larger than 121 inches. The new category Light duty vehicle, short wheel base is found in table 4-11 and includes passenger cars, light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles with a wheelbase (WB) equal to or less than 121 inches. This edition of 4-12 is not comparable to editions from 2009 or earlier.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For 1993-2006, nearly all vehicles in this category are light trucks, which include vans, pickup trucks, and sport utility vehicles.  In 1995, the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration revised its vehicle categories beginning with 1993 data. The new categories were passenger car, other 2-axle 4-tire vehicle, single-unit 2-axle 6-tire or more truck, and combination truck.  Prior to 1993, some minivans and sport utility vehicles were included under the passenger car category. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
