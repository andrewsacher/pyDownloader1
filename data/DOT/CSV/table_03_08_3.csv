NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Bureau Economic Analysis has changed the reference year for chained dollar estimates from 1999 onward as part of the comprehensive revision of the national income and product accounts in 2014. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chained (2009) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2009 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This table (Chained 2009 dollars) is not comparable with the previous'  version (Chained 2005 dollars). Chained 2005 dollars estimates for earlier years can be found in the 2013 edition of NTS, table 3-8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
