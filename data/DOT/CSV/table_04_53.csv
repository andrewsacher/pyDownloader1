"a  ""Adjustments"" comprise the addition of U.S. territories and the subtraction of military bunker fuels and international bunker fuels.  ""Other sources"" comprise the addition of gas flaring, CO2 in natural gas, cement production, other industrial, and limestone consumption.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Electric utility emissions are distributed across end-use sectors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers may not add to totals due to independent rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tons of carbon can be converted to tons of carbon dioxide gas by multiplying by 3.667.  One ton of carbon equals 3.667 tons of carbon dioxide gas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Numbers in this table may not be comparable to the numbers in the previous edition of the report due to changes in methodology of estimation by the Energy Information Administration.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
