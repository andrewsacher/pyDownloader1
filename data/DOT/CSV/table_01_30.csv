"a These data are derived from the Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM). TERM uses statistically determined decay curves to simulate the deterioration of the Nation's transit vehicles, facilities, and other infrastructure components.  National Transit Database (NTD) data are applied to these decay curves to estimate conditions.  Only the condition of directly operated facilities are provided for 1995, 1997 and 2000.  The NTD began gathering information on facilities owned by bus systems providing services under contract in 1999 (known as purchased transportation), however, TERM did not base condition estimates on this full set of facilities until 2002.
