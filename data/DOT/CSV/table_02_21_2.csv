NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Vehicle-miles in this table and in table 2-23 are taken from NHTSA revised data and are not based exclusively on USDOT, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) data.  The change was made to reflect the different vehicle classification schemes used by FHWA and NHTSA. Thus, Vehicle-miles for passenger cars, and light and large trucks in this table and table 2-23 should not be compared with Vehicle-miles in chapter 1, which are taken directly from FHWA. Rates per 100 million vehicle-miles figures may differ from those in the source data due to rounding by the source. Vehicles involved in crashes figures in this table are not comparable to figures in previous editions due to a change in the source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
