NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Chained (2009) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2009 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This table is deflated using data from the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts tables, table 2.4.4U. Lines 203, 199, 201 and 197 are used respectively to deflate their corresponding rows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This table (Chained 2009 dollars) is not comparable with the previous'  version (Chained 2005 dollars ). Chained 2005 dollars estimates for earlier years can be found in the 2013 edition of NTS, table 3-19.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
