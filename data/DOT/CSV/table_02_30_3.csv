"a Seat belt use is as of the Fall each year except in 1999 (December), 2001 (June), 2002 (June), 2003 (June), 2004 (June), 2005 (June).  Motorcycle helmet use is as of the Fall each year except in 1996 (January), 2002 (June), 2004 (June), and 2005 (June).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Beginning in 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) no longer computes an overall light truck belt use estimate.  Instead, belt use is computed separately for motorists in: (1) vans and sport utility vehicles, and (2) pickup trucks. Additionally, NHTSA no longer reports separate statistics for passengers and drivers, except at the overall level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Includes pickup trucks, vans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d  In 1994, Riders (Operators) and Passengers were counted as helmeted if wearing any type of helmet.  Since then, only those  Riders (Operators) and Passengers wearing safety helmets that met U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) standards were counted. Those safety helmets that do not meet DOT standards were treated as if the operator/rider were not wearing a helmet. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
