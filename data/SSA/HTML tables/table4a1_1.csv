"a Beginning in 1979, benefit payments scheduled to be paid on January 3 of a given year were paid on December 31 of the preceding year as required by the statutory provision included in the 1977 Social Security Amendments for early delivery of benefit payments when the normal payment delivery date is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday. Such advance payments have occurred about every 7 years, first for benefits scheduled for January 3, 1982. For comparability with other historical years, all trust fund operations and asset reserves reflect the 12 months of benefits scheduled for payment in each year.",,,,,
"Note: The annual net increase in the fund is the change in the asset reserves from the end of one year to the end of the next.  In 1982, the fund borrowed money from the Disability Insurance and Hospital Insurance Trust Funds, and repaid the borrowed amounts in 1985 and 1986. For each of these years, the net increase  in the fund is equal to total receipts less total expenditures, plus amounts  borrowed or less amounts repaid. Asset reserves, except for relatively small cash amounts,  are invested in Federal Government securities.",,,,,
