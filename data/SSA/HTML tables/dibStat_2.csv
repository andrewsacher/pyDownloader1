"a  The number of applications is for disabled-worker benefits only and,  as such, excludes disabled child's and disabled widow(er)'s benefits.  These applications are those received at Social Security field offices,  teleservice centers, and claims filed electronically on the internet.  Applications ultimately result in either a denial or award of  benefits. These counts include applications that are denied because the individual is not insured for  disability benefits.  Because the application data are tabulated on a weekly basis,  some months include 5 weeks of data while others include only 4 weeks.  This weekly method of tabulation accounts for much of the month-to-month  variation in the monthly application data. This method also  occasionally causes quarterly data to have either 12 or 14 weeks of data  instead of 13 weeks, annual data may include an extra week of data.  b  Award data are unedited and may contain duplicates.  Awards as a percentage of applications is a crude allowance rate. This  rate expresses the number of awards in a given time period as a percentage  of the number of applications in the same time period. Some of the awards  in any time period, however, resulted from applications in previous time  period(s).  c  The number of terminations is the number of beneficiaries who leave  the disability rolls for any reason. The number is calculated on the  basis of the change in the total number of entitled beneficiaries  (those in current payment status plus those whose benefits are  withheld for any reason) and the number of awards. The termination  rate is the ratio of the terminations to the number  of beneficiaries who could potentially leave the rolls. This latter  number is approximated as the sum of the number entitled at the beginning  of the time period plus half the number of awards in that period.",,,,,,,,,,,,
