"a Beginning in 1979, benefit payments scheduled to be paid on January 3 of a given year were paid on December 31 of the preceding year as required by the statutory provision included in the 1977 Social Security Amendments for early delivery of benefit payments when the normal payment delivery date is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday. Such advance payments have occurred about every 7 years, first for benefits scheduled for January 3, 1982. For comparability with other historical years, all trust fund operations and asset reserves reflect the 12 months of benefits scheduled for payment in each year.",,,,,
"Note: The annual net increase in the funds is the  change in the asset reserves from the end of one year to the end of the next. In 1982, the  Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund borrowed money from the Hospital  Insurance Trust Fund, and repaid the borrowed amounts in 1985 and 1986.  For each of these years, the net increase in the funds is equal to total receipts less total expenditures, plus amounts borrowed or less amounts repaid. Asset reserves, except for relatively small cash amounts, are invested in Federal Government securities. For trust fund data prior  to 1957, see OASI data (the Disability Trust Fund  was established in 1957).",,,,,
