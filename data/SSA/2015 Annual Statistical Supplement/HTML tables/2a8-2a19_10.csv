,"NOTE: The special minimum PIA is payable to some persons who have had covered employment or self-employment for many years at low earnings. The formula computes a benefit based on years of coverage rather than earnings, and it applies only if the resulting benefit exceeds the benefit computed by any other method. The usual rates of actuarial reduction apply for retirement before the full retirement age. Although delayed retirement credits are not applicable to the benefit derived from the special minimum PIA, the benefit will be raised if necessary to equal the benefit derived from the regularly computed PIA plus any delayed retirement credits."
,"a. For 1951–1978, the amount of Social Security covered earnings needed for a year of coverage is 25 percent of the effective annual maximum taxable earnings."
,"b. For 1937–1950, the years of coverage are determined by the number (not exceeding 14) obtained by dividing total creditable wages in 1937–1950 by $900 (any remainder is disregarded)."
,"c. For 1979–1990, the amount of Social Security covered earnings needed for a year of coverage is 25 percent of what the annual maximum taxable earnings would have been if the statutory increases in the maximum under the 1977 amendments had not been enacted (the ""old law"" contribution and benefit base)."
,"d. For 1991 and following, a year of substantial coverage under the Windfall Elimination Provision remains 25 percent of the old law base, while the criterion for the special minimum PIA was changed to 15 percent of the base."
