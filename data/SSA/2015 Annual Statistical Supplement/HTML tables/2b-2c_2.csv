SOURCE: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.,"NOTES: The structure of Medicare has become increasingly complex over the years. This table provides a summary of Medicare cost sharing and premium provisions. It should be used as an overview and general guide. It is not intended to explain fully all of the provisions or exclusions of the applicable Medicare laws, regulations, and rulings. Original sources of authority should be consulted for specific details.
          Values for certain 2016 premiums, copayments, and out-of-pocket thresholds not shown in the table are provided in footnotes as applicable. Corresponding values for prior years are available in previous editions of this table.
          . . . = not applicable.
        ","a. As of November 16, 2015.",b. Deductible and coinsurance amounts begin in January unless otherwise noted. Monthly premium amounts took effect in July through 1983 and in January beginning in 1984.,"c. Standard premium rate for voluntary enrollment by certain aged and disabled individuals not otherwise entitled to Hospital Insurance (HI). (Most individuals aged 65 and older and many disabled individuals under age 65 are insured for HI benefits without payment of any premium.) Beginning in 1994, a reduced premium is available to premium-paying HI enrollees with at least 30 quarters of Medicare-covered employment (either their own or through a current or former spouse if the marriage meets certain duration criteria). In most cases, a surcharge applies for beneficiaries who enroll after their initial enrollment period.","d. Most services under Part B are subject to the annual deductible and coinsurance percentages shown. Some noteworthy exceptions are footnoted; others include (1) laboratory tests paid under the clinical lab fee, home health agency services, and certain prescribed preventive care services, which are currently not subject to the deductible or coinsurance and for which the beneficiary pays nothing; (2) outpatient psychiatric services, for which the coinsurance was 50 percent through 2009 and phased down over the 5-year period 2010–2014 to its current level of 20 percent; and (3) most services reimbursed under the outpatient hospital prospective payment system, for which the coinsurance percentage varies by service but currently falls in the range of 20 percent to 50 percent.","e. Represents standard premium for voluntary enrollment in Part B. This is the amount paid by most beneficiaries in most years (2010, 2011, and 2016 are notable exceptions). Three factors can alter the premium paid by a beneficiary: enrollment after the initial enrollment period, for which a surcharge may apply; adjustments for beneficiaries whose income is above certain thresholds; and a ""hold-harmless"" provision that prohibits Part B premium increases that exceed the dollar amount of a beneficiary's Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. See also footnotes u, w, x, and z.",f. Enrollment in Part D is voluntary. Substantial premium and cost-sharing subsidies and waivers are available for Part D beneficiaries who meet certain low-income and limited-resources criteria. Subsidy levels vary.,"g. Under the standard Part D benefit design, beneficiaries pay an initial deductible and 25 percent of the remaining costs until reaching the initial coverage limit. Between the initial coverage limit and the out-of-pocket threshold is a ""coverage gap."" However, provisions have been enacted that lower out-of-pocket costs in the coverage gap gradually between 2010 and 2020. In 2016, beneficiaries in the coverage gap (excluding low-income enrollees eligible for cost-sharing subsidies) will receive a 50-percent manufacturer discount and a 5-percent drug plan benefit on applicable brand-name prescription drugs and a 42-percent drug plan benefit on covered generic drugs. (See previous editions of this table for coverage gap reductions in 2010–2015.) In determining out-of-pocket costs, costs reimbursed through insurance are not counted toward the out-of-pocket threshold, except for cost-sharing assistance provided to low-income enrollees by Part D and State Pharmacy Assistance programs and, starting in 2011, the 50-percent manufacturer discount on applicable brand-name drugs purchased by enrollees in the Part D coverage gap. For costs incurred after the out-of-pocket threshold is reached, ""catastrophic coverage"" requires enrollees to pay the greater of a 5-percent coinsurance or a small copayment (for 2016, $2.95 for generic or preferred multi-source drugs and $7.40 for other drugs). Many Part D plans differ from this standard coverage design; in fact, the majority of beneficiaries are enrolled in plans with low or no deductibles, flat payments for covered drugs, and, in some cases, additional partial coverage in the coverage gap.","h. The Part D premiums paid by individual beneficiaries equal the base beneficiary premium adjusted by a number of factors. Premiums vary significantly from one plan to another and seldom equal the base beneficiary premium. The estimated average monthly premium for 2016, as calculated prior to the start of the year (based on the bids submitted by Part D plans, the specific plan-by-plan premiums, and the estimated number of beneficiaries in each plan) is $32.50. This estimate does not include three factors that can alter the premium paid by the beneficiary: enrollment after the initial enrollment period, for which a surcharge may apply; additional premium amounts for beneficiaries with income above certain thresholds; and reductions in premiums for beneficiaries meeting certain low-income and limited-resources requirements.","i. Professional inpatient services of pathologists and radiologists not subject to deductible or coinsurance, beginning in April 1968.",j. Beginning in April 1968.,"k. Home health services not subject to coinsurance, beginning in January 1973.","l. Standard monthly premiums for July and August 1973 were reduced to $5.80 and $6.10, respectively, by the Cost of Living Council.","m. Home health services not subject to deductible, beginning July 1, 1981.","n. Professional inpatient services of pathologists and radiologists not subject to deductible or coinsurance, but only when physician accepts assignment.","o. Effective October 1, 1982, professional inpatient services of pathologists and radiologists are subject to deductible and coinsurance.","p. The 1989 deductible was applied on an annual basis rather than a benefit-period basis. Once the beneficiary paid the deductible, Medicare paid the balance of expenses for covered hospital services, regardless of the number of days of hospitalization (except for psychiatric hospital care, which was still limited to 190 days).","q. In 1989 the coinsurance amount was equal to 20 percent of the estimated national average daily cost of covered skilled nursing facility care, the beneficiary paid the coinsurance amount for the first 8 days of care during the year, and benefits were available for up to 150 days of care during the year.",r. Includes the standard monthly Part B premium and a supplemental monthly flat premium under the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988. Persons enrolled in Part B only and residents of Puerto Rico and other territories and commonwealths paid lower supplemental flat premiums.,"s. A temporary Medicare-endorsed prescription drug discount card program was offered. See the Medicare section of ""Program Descriptions and Legislative History"" (page 54 in this Supplement).","t. Under the defined standard benefit design, the out-of-pocket threshold of $4,850 for 2016 is equivalent to an estimated $7,515.22 in total covered drug costs for enrollees not eligible for low-income cost-sharing subsidies. (This estimated amount is based on an average blend of brand-name and generic drugs used while in the Part D coverage gap. In determining out-of-pocket costs, the dollar value of the 50-percent manufacturer discount on applicable brand-name drugs is included, even though the beneficiary does not pay it. The dollar values of the 42-percent drug plan benefit on covered generic drugs and the 5-percent drug plan benefit on applicable brand-name drugs do not count toward out-of-pocket spending.) For enrollees eligible for low-income cost-sharing subsidies, the 2016 out-of-pocket threshold is equivalent to $7,062.50 in total covered drug costs. See previous editions of this table for prior years' equivalent total covered drug costs.","u. See footnote e. The 2016 Part B income-related monthly adjustment amounts and total monthly premium amounts to be paid by beneficiaries, according to income level and filing status, are shown in the Medicare section of ""Program Descriptions and Legislative History"" (page 41 in this Supplement). See previous editions of the Supplement for prior years' adjustment and premium amounts.","v. For beneficiaries paying an income-related adjustment, the government amounts are to be reduced accordingly. See also footnotes e and u.","w. Most Part B enrollees are protected by a ""hold-harmless"" provision prohibiting Part B premium increases that exceed the dollar amount of an individual's Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Because the 2010 COLA equaled 0 percent, about 73 percent of Part B enrollees continued to pay the 2009 premium amount in 2010.","x. See footnote w. Because the 2011 COLA again equaled 0 percent, most Part B enrollees continued to pay the same premium amount they paid in 2010.","y. See footnote g. The 2016 Part D income-related monthly adjustment amounts to be paid by beneficiaries, according to income level and filing status, are shown in the Medicare section of ""Program Descriptions and Legislative History"" (page 42 in this Supplement). See previous editions of the Supplement for prior years' adjustment amounts.","z. See footnote w. Because the 2016 COLA equals 0 percent, about 70 percent of enrollees continue to pay the 2015 premium amount in 2016. The Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2015 specifies that the 2016 actuarial rate for enrollees aged 65 or older be determined as if the hold-harmless provision did not apply, thereby yielding a lower 2016 Part B standard premium rate (and deductible) than would otherwise have been the case. The BBA also mandates that the revenue lost because of the lower premium rate (excluding forgone income-related premium revenue) is to be replaced by a transfer from the General Fund of the Treasury to the Part B account of the SMI trust fund, which will be repaid over time using a $3.00 fee added to the monthly premium payment. The $3.00 fee does not affect government financing amounts.",CONTACT: John Shatto (410) 786-0706 or statistics@ssa.gov.
