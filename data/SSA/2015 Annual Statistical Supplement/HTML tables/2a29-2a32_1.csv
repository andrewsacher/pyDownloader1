,,,,,,NOTE: . . . = not applicable.
,,,,,,"a. Monthly test for self-employment income is defined in terms of substantial services. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1977, monthly test eliminated for wage and self-employment income except that each individual may use a monthly test for 1 grace year, usually the year of retirement."
,,,,,,"b. Earnings of a retired-worker beneficiary affect total monthly family benefit. Earnings of a dependent or survivor beneficiary affect only his or her benefit. However, effective January 1985, earnings of a retired-worker beneficiary do not affect the benefit to a divorced spouse who has been divorced at least 2 years. Effective for benefits after December 1990, the 2-year requirement is waived if the worker was entitled to benefits before the divorce."
,,,,,,c. Applied to self-employment income only.
,,,,,,d. Special provisions for earnings in noncovered employment outside the United States.
,,,,,,e. Became effective because of automatic adjustment provisions mandated by legislation in 1972 and 1973.
,,,,,,"f. Full retirement age (FRA) is 65 for beneficiaries who attain age 62 (age 60 for widow(er)s) before 2000, gradually increasing to age 67 for beneficiaries who attain age 62 in 2022 or later."
,,,,,,g. Discretionary increase included in legislation of 1977.
,,,,,,"h. Actual amount is $1,041.66 2/3."
,,,,,,"i. Actual amount is $1,208.33 1/3."
,,,,,,"j. Actual amount is $1,291.66 2/3."
,,,,,,"k. Public Law (P.L.) 106-182, enacted April 7, 2000, eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary reaches FRA. The annual earnings test that applies in the year of attainment of FRA is based on the annual limits established under P.L. 104-121 (including the $1 for $3 withholding rate). In determining annual earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test under this legislation, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be considered. P.L. 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year, which continues to be pegged to increases in the average wage."
