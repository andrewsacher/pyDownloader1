,,,,,,,,,,"a. National average wage levels. For years before 1978, average wages were determined from wages earned during the first quarter of the year and reported to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for Social Security tax purposes. These wages were then multiplied by 4 to obtain the average wage for the year. For 1973–1977, from data collected on all taxable wages reported to SSA; for 1957–1972, based on 1 percent statistical sample; for 1951–1956, based on 1/10 of 1 percent statistical sample. For 1978–1984, from wage data collected by the Internal Revenue Service during processing of annual tax returns. For years after 1984, from W-2 data processed by SSA. For years after 1977, the average wage amounts have been adjusted to be consistent with the pre-1978 series."
,,,,,,,,,,"b. A worker's earnings for each year after 1950 and through the second year before the year of first eligibility are indexed by multiplying covered earnings, up to the maximum taxable amounts, by specified indexing factors (see Table 2.A8). The indexing factor for a given year represents the ratio of the average annual wage for the second year before the year of first eligibility to the average annual wage for the year to be indexed. For example, if the year of first eligibility is 2014, the indexing factor for 1982 is $44,321.67/14,531.34 or 3.0500745. Multiplication of maximum taxable earnings of $32,400 for 1982 by this factor gives maximum indexed earnings of $98,822.41 for 1982."
