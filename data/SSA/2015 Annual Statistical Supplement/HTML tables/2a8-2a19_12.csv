,,,,,,"a. The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for December 1999 was originally determined to be 2.4 percent, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The underlying CPI was later recomputed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; a 2.5 percent COLA would have been consistent with the recomputed CPI. Pursuant to Public Law 106-554, benefits were calculated and paid in August 2001 and later as if the COLA for December 1999 had been 2.5 percent. Affected beneficiaries received a one-time payment to cover the shortfall that occurred before August 2001.",0
