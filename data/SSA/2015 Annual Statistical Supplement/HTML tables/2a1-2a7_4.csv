"Table shows the maximum contributions (taxes) received by the trust funds from an individual worker. Occasional temporary tax credits and rate reductions affect the amounts paid by workers, and are summarized in footnotes as applicable.",,,,,,,,,,
"a. In 1984, the 5.7 percent OASDI tax on taxable wages of employees was offset by a tax credit of 0.3 percent, resulting in an effective employee tax rate of 5.4 percent. However, the OASDI trust funds received the full 5.7 percent because of a general revenue transfer equivalent to 0.3 percent of taxable wages. Similar credits of 2.7 percent, 2.3 percent, and 2.0 percent were allowed against the combined OASDI and HI taxes on net earnings from self-employment in 1984, 1985, and from 1986 to 1989, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,
b. Upper limit on earnings subject to HI taxes was repealed by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993.,,,,,,,,,,
"c. For 2011 and 2012, the combined OASDI payroll tax rate was reduced by 2.0 percent for employees and for self-employed workers. Thus, for 2011, the maximum OASDI contribution for employees was $4,485.60 and for self-employed workers was $11,107.20; and for 2012, the maximum OASDI contribution for employees was $4,624.20 and for self-employed workers was $11,450.40. The authorizing legislation does not specify percentage reductions attributable to the separate OASI and DI trust funds. Amounts equal to the revenue forgone were transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to the trust funds.",,,,,,,,,,
"d. Beginning in 2013, an additional HI tax of 0.9 percent is assessed on earned income exceeding $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. This additional HI tax amount is not reflected in the contribution amounts shown in the table.",,,,,,,,,,
