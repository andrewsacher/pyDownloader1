Federal medical assistance percentage: State share = (S2/N2) x 45 or (45/N2) x S2; Federal share = 100 – state share with 50–83 percent limits,,,,,,,0
b. This is the Title XXI enhanced federal medical assistance percentage rate specified in section 2105(b) of the Act. The enhanced federal medical assistance percentage cannot exceed 85 percent.,,,,,,,0
