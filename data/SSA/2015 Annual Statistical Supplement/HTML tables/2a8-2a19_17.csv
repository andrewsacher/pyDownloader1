"NOTES: Widows and widowers can elect reduced monthly benefits at age 60 or, if disabled, as early as age 50. Surviving divorced spouses can also receive benefits if married to the worker for at least 10 years and not remarried before age 60 (age 50 if disabled).",,,,,
"a. If birthday is January 1, refer to previous year.",,,,,
"b. Monthly reduction percentages are approximate due to rounding. For survivors whose full retirement age (FRA) is 65, the monthly rate of reduction for the first 60 months immediately preceding FRA is 19/40 of 1 percent of the worker's primary insurance amount (PIA), with a maximum reduction of 28.5 percent at age 60. For survivors whose FRA is older than 65, the amount of reduction for each month prior to FRA is adjusted accordingly to ensure that the maximum reduction at age 60 remains 28.5 percent of the worker's PIA.",,,,,
