"c. With the availability of Part D drug coverage and low-income subsidies beginning in 2006, Medicaid is no longer the primary payer for full-benefit dual eligibles. States are subject to a contribution requirement and must pay the Part D account in the SMI trust fund a portion of their estimated forgone drug costs for this population.

e. Values after 2005 include additional premiums for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans that are deducted from beneficiaries' Social Security checks.
