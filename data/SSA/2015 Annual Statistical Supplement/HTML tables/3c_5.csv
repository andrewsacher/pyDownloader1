Includes persons receiving Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), SSI, or both.",b. The number of OASDI disabled adult child beneficiaries aged 18–64 also receiving SSI was estimated on the basis of the number of such beneficiaries aged 18 or older for the same year and on the comparative size of the two groups at the end of 1988.,"c. December data for OASDI disabled beneficiaries also receiving SSI were not available. Instead, the average of the September 1989 and March 1990 numbers was used.",CONTACT: (410) 965-0090 or statistics@ssa.gov.,,,,,
