"b. In 1984, the 5.7 percent OASDI tax on taxable wages of employees was offset by a tax credit of 0.3 percent, resulting in an effective employee tax rate of 5.4 percent. However, the OASDI trust funds received the full 5.7 percent because of a general revenue transfer equivalent to 0.3 percent of taxable wages. Similar credits of 2.7 percent, 2.3 percent, and 2.0 percent were allowed against the combined OASDI and HI taxes on net earnings from self-employment in 1984, 1985, and from 1986 to 1989, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,0
