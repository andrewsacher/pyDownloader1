,,,"NOTES: Earnings are net of any wage subsidies and impairment-related expenses.
          The guidelines for substantial gainful activity (SGA) for self-employed individuals differ from the guidelines for wage earners.
Self-employment activity is generally examined in terms of time spent and degree of effort, as compared with that of nondisabled self-employed individuals.

,,,"a. Earnings above the maximum amount ordinarily demonstrate SGA; earnings below the minimum amount show that SGA has not occurred. When earnings are between the minimum and maximum, other factors are considered."
,,,"b. The amendments in 1977 provided that, effective 1978, earnings of blind beneficiaries would be evaluated under different SGA guidelines from those of nonblind beneficiaries."
,,,c. Pre-1978 guidelines are the same as those for nonblind beneficiaries.
,,,d. Annual amounts were determined by automatic adjustments linked to increases in average wage level. The amounts equal the monthly exempt amounts under the earnings test applicable to beneficiaries who have reached full retirement age (see Table 2.A29 for the amounts for 1983–1995).
