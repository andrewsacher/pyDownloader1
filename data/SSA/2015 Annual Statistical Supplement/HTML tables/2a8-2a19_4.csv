,,,,,,"NOTES: Eligible workers are those who attained age 62, became disabled, or died in the given year.
          AIME = average indexed monthly earnings; AMW =average monthly wage; PIA = primary insurance amount; -- = not available.
"
,,,,,,"a. For workers who attained age 62 in the 1979–1983 period, the PIA cannot be less than that derived from the PIA table in effect in December 1978 (approximated by the PIA formula in Table 2.A16) in the basis of provisions in effect before 1979 but excluding earnings after year aged 61 in computations of AMW and including any general benefit increase after year aged 61."
,,,,,,"b. The amendments in 1977 provided for annual automatic adjustments of bend points (AIME brackets) in benefit formula in proportion to increases in average wage level. As a result, separate formulas are applicable to workers who were first eligible in successive calendar years. The legislation also froze the minimum PIA at $122."
,,,,,,c. Not subject to automatic adjustments until earlier of year of attainment of age 65 or year of first receipt of benefits.
,,,,,,"d. In 1981, legislation eliminated the minimum PIA for workers who attain age 62 or die after 1981 (after 1991 for members of certain religious orders). In August 1981, legislation would have eliminated the minimum PIA effective March 1982 for workers who attained age 62 before November 1981 or who died (before attaining age 62) before March 1982; for all others, the minimum would have been eliminated effective November 1981. This legislation was superseded in December 1981 by legislation that restored the minimum PIA for workers who attained age 62 or died (before attaining age 62) before 1982."
,,,,,,"e. The cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for December 1999 was originally determined to be 2.4 percent, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The underlying CPI was later recomputed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; a 2.5 percent COLA would have been consistent with the recomputed CPI. Pursuant to Public Law 106-554, benefits were calculated and paid in August 2001 and later as if the COLA for December 1999 had been 2.5 percent. Affected beneficiaries received a one-time payment to cover the shortfall that occurred before August 2001."
