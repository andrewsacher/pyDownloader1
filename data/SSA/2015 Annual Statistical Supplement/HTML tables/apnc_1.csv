2000,"Expansion of CPS sample interviewed from about 50,000 households to about 78,000 households nationwide.

2002,"For the first time, the CPS ASEC of 2003 recorded multiple categories for respondents who identified themselves with more than one race. We do not know how people who reported more than one race in 2002 previously reported their race. Therefore, there is no single way to compare changes to poverty by race between 2001 and 2002. The “Asian or Pacific Islander” race category was divided into two groups: “Asians” and “Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders.”","P60-222, pp. 2–3, 5"
