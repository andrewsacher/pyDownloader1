1977,"Mandatory annual determination, beginning in 1978, as to whether an adjustment is required in the amount of wages and self-employment earnings an individual needs in order to be credited with a quarter of coverage (QC) in the succeeding year. The amount required for a QC is the product of $250 (in effect in 1978) multiplied by the following quotient: the national average wage for the year before the year of determination, divided by the average wage for 1976 (see Table 2.A8 for average annual wages after 1950). The resulting product, rounded to the nearest multiple of $10, is the new amount required for a QC. In no case, however, is the new amount reduced below the amount in effect in the year of determination.",0
,Maximum amount of taxable and creditable earnings,0
1972,"The 1972 Act (as modified by the legislation in 1973) mandated a determination in 1974, and in every subsequent year in which a cost-of-living benefit increase is established, as to whether an adjustment is required in the maximum amount of annual earnings that will be taxed and credited toward benefits.",0
,"The determination in the years after 1975 is made by multiplying the ""maximum"" in effect in the year of determination by the following quotient: the national average wage for the year before the year of determination, divided by the average wage for the year before the most recent year in which an automatic determination was made that resulted in an increase or in which an increase in the maximum was enacted. (See Table 2.A8 for annual amounts of the average wage after 1950). The resulting product, rounded to the nearest multiple of $300, is the new maximum amount of taxable and creditable earnings, effective with respect to remuneration paid after the year of determination and with respect to taxable years beginning after that year. In no case, however, is the maximum reduced to an amount below the maximum in the year of determination.",0
1976,"In the 1974 and 1975 determinations, the quotient was the average wage for the year of determination, estimated from data for the first calendar quarter, divided by the corresponding amount for the year before the year of determination. Public Law (P.L.) 94-202 (signed January 2, 1976) revised the adjustment method by increasing by a year the lag in average wages used in the computation. Thus, for example, the determination in 1976 was based on the percentage increase in the average wage from 1974 to 1975.",0
1977,"Statutory in lieu of automatic increases in the maximum instituted for 1979, 1980, and 1981. Also, for purposes of establishing a ""year of coverage"" used in the computation of the special minimum primary insurance amount PIA, annual maximum taxable and creditable earnings after 1978 are the amounts that would have been determined under the automatic adjustment provisions if the statutory increases in the maximum under the 1977 Act had not been enacted (see Table 2.A12a).",0
1989,"Automatic increases in the maximum for 1990, 1991, and 1992 determined under a transitional rule, specified by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, for computing ""deemed"" average annual wage for 1988, 1989, and 1990. The purpose of the legislation was to include contributions to certain ""deferred compensation"" plans, most importantly section 401(k) pension plans, in the average annual average wage.",0
1994,"The determination for years after 1994 is made by multiplying $60,600, the ""maximum"" for 1994, by the following quotient: the national average wage index for the year before the year in which the determination is made, divided by the national average wage index for 1992. (See Table 2.A8 for annual amounts of the national average wage index.) The resulting product, rounded to the nearest $300, is the new maximum amount of taxable and creditable earnings, effective with respect to remuneration paid in (and taxable years beginning in) the year following the year the determination is made. In no case, however, is the new maximum reduced to an amount below the maximum in the year of determination.",0
,Benefits,0
,Computation,0
1977,"New benefit computation method based on average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) after 1950, effective for workers first eligible after 1978. Provision for automatic adjustment of the dollar amounts, or bend points, defining (1) the AIME brackets in the PIA formula (see Table 2.A11) and (2) the PIA brackets in the maximum family benefit formula (see Table 2.A13). New bend points are established by multiplying the bend points in effect in 1979—$180 and $1,085 for the PIA formula and $230, $332, and $433 for the maximum family benefit formula—by the following quotient: the national average wage for the second year before the year for which the determination was made, divided by the average wage for 1977 (see Table 2.A8 for average annual wages after 1950). The resulting products, rounded to the nearest dollar, are the new bend points.",0
1980,Modified maximum family benefit formula applicable to workers with initial entitlement to disability benefits in or after July 1980 (see Table 2.A14). New formula for disabled workers has no bend points subject to automatic adjustment.,0
,Cost-of-living increase,0
1972,"Under the original provisions (based on 1972 and 1973 legislation), the arithmetical mean of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) for January, February, and March in the year of determination was compared with the arithmetical mean of the CPI for the later of (a) January, February, and March of the year in which the last effective cost-of-living increase was established or (b) the 3 months of the calendar quarter in which the effective month of the last general benefit increase occurred. (Before the introduction, in 1977, of the alternative CPI series for ""all urban consumers,"" or the CPI-U, the CPI-W was referred to as the CPI.) If the percentage increase in the CPI, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent, was at least 3.0 (the triggering requirement), a cost-of-living benefit increase was established and the level of benefits was increased by the same percentage, effective for June of the year in which the determination was made.",0
1983,"The 1983 Act moved the effective date for a cost-of-living benefit increase from June to December, beginning in 1983, and eliminated the ""triggering requirement"" for the 1983 increase only. Effective with the determination made in 1984, the two periods used in calculating the CPI-W percentage increase were shifted from the first to the third quarter.",0
,"The 1983 Act also introduced an alternative method for determining the size of a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). This method, called the stabilizer provision, is applied when the ratio of the combined OASDI trust fund assets to estimated outgo falls below a certain percentage. The ""triggering"" percentage is 15 percent for 1985–1988 and 20 percent for years after 1988. Under these circumstances, the COLA is based on the lesser of the CPI-W percentage increase determined above or the increase in average wages. The latter increase is the percentage, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent by which the national average wage for the year before the year of determination exceeds the average wage for the year before the most recent year in which either a cost-of-living increase or a general benefit increase occurred. (See Table 2.A8 for the annual amount of the average wage after 1950 and footnote a in that table for the underlying data sources.)",0
,"The 1983 legislation also included a provision for making up any benefit increases that are based on a lower wage increase rather than on the increase in the cost of living. When the fund ratio is greater than 32 percent, additional increases will be provided so that benefits are increased to the level at which they would have been if all increases had been based on the CPI-W. (See Table 2.A19 for the cumulative effect of statutory and automatic increases in benefits.)",0
1986,"Triggering requirement eliminated for cost-of-living increases in and after 1986 by P.L. 99-509 (signed October 21, 1986).",0
2001,"The COLA for December 1999 was originally determined to be 2.4 percent, based on the CPI. The underlying CPI was later recomputed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS); a 2.5 percent COLA would have been consistent with the recomputed CPI. Pursuant to P.L. 106-554, benefits were calculated and paid in August 2001 and later as if the COLA for December 1999 had been 2.5 percent. Affected beneficiaries received a one-time payment to cover the shortfall that occurred before August 2001.",0
2007,"The rules for calculating automatic cost-of-living increases to PIAs under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act) were revised. The arithmetical mean of the CPI for each month is computed for the beginning and ending quarters of the measuring period, and the result is rounded to the same number of decimal places as the published CPI figures. Through December 2006, BLS published CPI figures rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent. BLS began publishing CPI figures rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of 1 percent in January 2007.",0
,Earnings test,0
1972,"The 1972 Act (as modified by the 1973 Acts) mandated a determination in 1974, and in every subsequent year in which a cost-of-living increase is established, as to whether an adjustment in the exempt amount—the amount of earnings permitted without reduction in benefits—is required.",0
,"The determination in the years after 1975 is made by multiplying the monthly exempt amount in effect in the year of determination by the following quotient: the national average wage for the year before the year of determination, divided by the average wage for the year before the most recent year in which an automatic determination was made that resulted in an increase or in which an increase in the exempt amount was enacted. (See Table 2.A8 for annual amounts of the average wage after 1950.) The resulting product, rounded to the nearest multiple of $10, is the new monthly exempt amount, effective with respect to remuneration paid after the year of determination and with respect to taxable year beginning after that year. In no case, however, is the new exempt amount reduced below the exempt amount in the year of determination. The new annual exempt amount is determined by multiplying the new monthly amount by 12.",0
1976,"In the 1974 and 1975 determinations, the quotient was the average wage for the year of determination, estimated from data for the first calendar quarter, divided by the corresponding amount for the year before the year of determination. P.L. 94-202 (signed January 2, 1976) revised the adjustment method by increasing by a year the lag in average wages used in the computation. Thus, for example, the 1976 determination was based on the percentage increase in the average wage from 1974 to 1975.",0
1994,"The determination for years after 1994 is made by multiplying the monthly exempt amounts in effect for 1994 ($930 for beneficiaries who have, $670 for beneficiaries who have not yet, reached ""full retirement age""; see footnote f in Table 2.A29) by the following quotient: the national average wage for the year before the year in which the determination is made, divided by the national average wage for 1992. (See Table 2.A8 for annual amounts of the national average wage.) The resulting products, rounded to the nearest $10, are the new monthly exempt amounts effective for the year following the year the determination is made. The new annual exempt amounts are determined by multiplying the new monthly amounts by 12.",0
1996,"P.L. 104-121, enacted March 29, 1996, suspended the automatic indexing of the exempt amounts through the year 2002 for workers aged–65–69. It legislated ad hoc increases in the annual exempt amounts to $12,500 in 1996; $13,500 in 1997; $14,500 in 1998; $15,500 in 1999; $17,000 in 2000; $25,000 in 2001; and $30,000 in 2002. Thereafter, the exempt amounts will increase automatically based on the annual increase in the national average wage as under the 1994 legislation.",0
2000,"P.L. 106-182, enacted April 7, 2000, eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary reaches full retirement age (FRA). The annual earnings test that applies in the year of attainment of FRA is based on the annual limits established under P.L. 104-121 (including the $1 for $3 withholding rate). In determining annual earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test under this legislation, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be considered. P.L. 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year, which continues to be pegged to increases in the average wage.",0
