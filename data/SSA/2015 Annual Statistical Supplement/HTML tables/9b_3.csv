",,,,,,
a. These data may not include second injury fund for all states and may understate total payments.,,,,,,
"b. States with exclusive funds (North Dakota, Ohio, Washington, and Wyoming) may have small amounts of benefits paid by private carriers. This is because some employers doing business in states with exclusive funds may be required by Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) provisions to obtain coverage from private carriers, or may obtain employer's liability coverage that the state fund is not authorized to provide. In addition, private carriers may provide excess compensation coverage in some of these states.",,,,,,
c. Includes individual self-insurers and group self-insurance.,,,,,,
d. South Carolina's State Accident Fund is not a competitive state fund.,,,,,,
"e. In 2008, West Virginia completed the transition from an exclusive state fund to a competitive fund. All benefits for workers injured after the transition are paid by private carriers.",,,,,,
"f. Federal benefits include those paid under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act for civilian employees; the portion of the Black Lung benefit program that is financed by employers; and a portion of benefits under the LHWCA that are not reflected in state data, namely, benefits paid by self-insured employers and special funds under the LHWCA.",,,,,,
