See the Social Security Program Rules page (https://www.socialsecurity.gov/regulations/index.htm) for specific laws, regulations, rulings, legislation, and a link to the Federal Register. Taxation of Social Security benefits is governed by the Internal Revenue Service Code. IRS describes the rules governing taxation of Social Security benefits in IRS publication 915, available at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p915.pdf."

,,,,,,,,,,,"a. Adjusted gross income (before Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits are considered), plus tax-exempt interest income, with further modification of adjusted gross income in some cases involving certain tax provisions of limited applicability among the beneficiary population."
,,,,,,,,,,,"b. Social Security and Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits, including workers' compensation benefits to the extent they cause a reduction in either of these two types of benefits."
,,,,,,,,,,,"c. For married couples filing joint returns, up to 50 percent of benefits are subject to income tax if gross income is more than $32,000 but less than $44,000. If gross income is less than $32,000, none of the Social Security benefits will be taxable. If gross income exceeds $44,000, up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits will be taxable income. Similar lower and upper level thresholds or ""base amounts"" for single individuals are $25,000 and $34,000. There is no similar threshold or base amount for married individuals who live together but file separate returns (for example, up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits in those cases may be considered taxable income)."
,,,,,,,,,,,d. Includes only married taxpayers filing separately who lived with their spouse at any time during the tax year; married individuals filing separately who did not live with their spouse are treated the same as unmarried individuals.
