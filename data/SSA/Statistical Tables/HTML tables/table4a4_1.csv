"a The amounts of cash benefits paid in each year do not reflect certain adjustments that were made for earlier periods. Such adjustments include reimbursements  beginning in 1983 for uncashed checks, a reimbursement in 2006 that corrected an accounting error over the period 1999-2005 related to voluntary income tax withholding,  and transfers in 2007-09 from the OASI Trust Fund to the DI Trust Fund to correct a trust fund allocation error made on payments to certain dually entitled disabled  beneficiaries.  b Vocational rehabilitation  services to disabled workers and disabled children under the 1965 Amendments  to the Social Security Act and to disabled widows and widowers under the 1967  Amendments to the Social Security Act.  c For 1937-39, refunds and  lump-sum death payments under the Social Security Act of 1935.  d Beginning with 2006, SMI amounts include both Parts B and D payments. e Less than $0.5 million. f The CY 2011 amounts were adjusted to include Medicare bonuses  paid to providers who complied with electronic health records guidelines. g The CY 2013 amounts were adjusted due to reclassification of some Medicare benefits.",,,,,,,,,,
