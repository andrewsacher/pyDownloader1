"a Beginning in 1979, benefit payments scheduled to be paid on January 3 of a given year were paid on December 31 of the preceding year as required by the statutory provision included in the 1977 Social Security Amendments for early delivery of benefit payments when the normal payment delivery date is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday. Such advance payments have occurred about every 7 years, first for benefits scheduled for January 3, 1982. For comparability with other historical years, all trust fund operations and asset reserves reflect the 12 months of benefits scheduled for payment in each year.  b Beginning in 1966, includes payments for vocational rehabilitation services furnished to disabled persons receiving benefits because of their disabilities. Beginning in 1983, amounts are reduced by amount of reimbursement for unnegotiated benefit checks.",,,,
