"Notes: Amounts by type of benefit are estimated. The amounts of benefits paid in each year generally do not reflect adjustments that were made for earlier periods. Such adjustments include reimbursements  beginning in 1983 for uncashed checks, a reimbursement in 2006 that corrected  an accounting error over the period 1999-2005 related to voluntary income tax withholding,  and transfers in 2007-09 from the OASI Trust Fund to the DI Trust Fund to correct a trust  fund allocation error made on payments to certain dually entitled disabled beneficiaries. Totals do not necessarily equal the sum of rounded components.",,,,
